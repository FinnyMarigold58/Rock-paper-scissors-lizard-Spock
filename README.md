# Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock
This is a simple Java version of Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock that I made for my CSA (Computer Science) class.

## Requirements Given
- Display a Title
- Give rules of the game
- Get user input
- Generate random opponent choice
- Determine and announce the winner (with what the opponent chose)
- Asf if the player would like to continue playing

This was to show our knowledge of things we had been learning (lists, arrays, user input, conditionals; like if statements, and other basic concepts). I took this a step further introducing enums, static class members, switch statements, etc to the code.
